Remarks:

* In case of move commands are being sent to rovers which require moving to the same grid square concurrently, rovers are waiting each other to avoid colliding. 
  * For instance; Rover1 got a instruction to move to Square(2,3)
  * If there is any other rover in the Square(2,3), Rover1 waits for them to leave
  * Rover1 will get into the Square(2,3) at the moment they left (max in 1 sec)

* If a rover has completed its mission or fell in await-rescue case, it just waits there which means that, that grid square will be blocked forever. This case could be seen in the console logs.
